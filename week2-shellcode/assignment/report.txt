For this week's assignment I decided to do the first 3 exercises from the easy category and 1 from the medium category.


easy1.asm
---------
  In order to display the message Hello World I first have to find where the message is stored in memory. In order to do that I jump to the message section where I have written my "Hello World\n" mesage and the use the `call` instruction to push the address of the messages location onto the stack and continue the program. Now that I have the message address on the stack, I can pop it into `ecx` so that I can then call the syscall SYS_write to STDOUT. 

  After that I must execute /usr/bin/wall with the single command line argument "hello". I push `hello` onto the stack, then I push `/usr/bin/wall` and then push the null pointers for the rest of the syscall (envp, argv).

  After that, we exit with exitcode 1.

easy2.asm + easy3.asm + medium5.asm
-----------------------------------

  I decided to comment most of the code because it gives a clearer view on what is going on when reading the assembly code. That is why will not go into detail here.
